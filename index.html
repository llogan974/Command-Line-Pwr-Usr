/*
Notes from Wes Bos command line power user
pwd
mkdir
touch
ls -l
ls -TAB
cd .. (or just ..)
cp -R
take
ls (up arrow)

Where are we in our files (what directory?)
pwd

Other prompts I already know:

Make a folder named command-line
mkdir command-line

Make a file named index.html:
touch index.html

List all items in the directory including time.
-l stands for "long"
ls -l

move up a level in the directory:
cd ..
or just:
..

know file/folder options:
while searching, hit "space" then tab

cd ../ (tab)
You can use arrows here

remove a file:
rm BUT DONT USE THIS!

Copying

R stands for recursive, and includes all files in a directory
cp -R /source-directory/* /destination/

Find all options available for a command:
ls -

make a directory and enter into it:
take directory

move through history of a certain type of command:
Search through recent 'ls' history commands
ls (up arrow)
